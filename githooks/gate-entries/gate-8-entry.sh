# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (#798)
#   The gate order used to BE the physical order of blocks in a 6341-line
#   hook, so changing the order meant moving thousands of lines. An attempt at
#   that also moved the hook epilogue, after which every gate past Gate 13
#   silently stopped running while `bash -n`, a line count and five ordering
#   tests all passed. Gate 5a stopped blocking and only a behavioural test
#   noticed. With one file per gate, order is a list of names in
#   pre-commit's GATE_ORDER and cannot detach a body from its position.
#
# THE BODY BELOW IS A BYTE-EXACT SLICE of the original block. It is wrapped
# in a function so the gate keeps its own variable scope, and is called from
# pre-commit at the point the driver reaches it. Edit the gate here from now
# on - there is no copy left in the hook.

# Gate body. `return` is used instead of `exit` so the driver decides to
# stop: see scripts/wrap-gate-entries.cjs for why the two are equivalent
# here, and why sub-shell exits are deliberately left as `exit`.
