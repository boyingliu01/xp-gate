# LLM Security Audit — Design Document (Round 2 Revised)

> **DEPRECATED (2026-06-05)**: The implementation described here (promptfoo + `llm-security-audit.yml` + `security:llm` npm script) was removed in PR #139. LLM/AI security evaluation has migrated to the external **skill-cert** project; tracking issue: #140. This document is preserved as historical design context only — do **not** treat its workflow/script/path references as current architecture.

**Issue**: #22 | **Priority**: P0 | **Status**: Round 2

---

## 1. Motivation

XP-Gate's Delphi Review and Sprint Flow depend on LLM calls. Current security is limited to PromptPressure's basic adversarial prompts — no systematic OWASP LLM security testing.

---

## 2. Architecture Decision: CI Audit, NOT a Gate

This is **NOT a numbered gate**. It's an **LLM Security Audit** running as a CI safety net (same pattern as Mutation Testing #21). Rationale:
- LLM calls are inherently non-deterministic and can't meet gate-level repeatability
- CI-only avoids blocking local commits for non-deterministic checks
- The audit catches provider/temporal vulnerabilities, not code-level regressions

---

## 3. Architecture.yaml Integration (Addressing ISA-LS-002, B-M7)

Add to `architecture.yaml`:

```yaml
security:
  llm_audit:
    description: "OWASP LLM Top 10 security audit for AI review pipeline"
    provider: "anthropic:messages:claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
    enabled: true
    max_tokens: 4096
    failure_threshold: 3  # CI fails only when 3+ tests have assertion failures (flaky-test tolerance)
    covered_categories:
      - LLM01  # Prompt Injection
      - LLM02  # Insecure Output Handling
      - LLM04  # Model DoS
      - LLM06  # Sensitive Information Disclosure
      - LLM08  # Excessive Agency
      - LLM09  # Overreliance
    excluded_categories:
      LLM03: "No fine-tuning pipeline — training data poisoning not applicable"
      LLM05: "Provider selection handled separately; supply chain covered by Dependabot (#24)"
      LLM07: "Promptfoo security config uses native assertions only, no custom plugins"
      LLM10: "Model weight theft protection is provider responsibility, not application-level"
```

---

## 4. OWASP Coverage (Addressing ISA-LS-003, B-M2, B-M3)

| Category | Covered? | Test |
|----------|----------|------|
| LLM01 — Prompt Injection | ✅ 3 tests | Direct, Indirect, Jailbreak (DAN) |
| LLM02 — Insecure Output Handling | ✅ 1 test | Destructive command recommendation |
| LLM04 — Model DoS | ✅ 1 test | Resource exhaustion with 10K chars |
| LLM06 — Sensitive Info | ✅ 1 test | API key/token disclosure + regex |
| LLM08 — Excessive Agency | ✅ 1 test | Auto-approve bypass |
| LLM09 — Overreliance | ✅ 1 test | Human-in-the-loop circumvention |
| LLM03 — Poisoning | ❌ | No fine-tuning pipeline |
| LLM05 — Supply Chain | ❌ | Covered by #24 (SCA) |
| LLM07 — Plugin Design | ❌ | No custom promptfoo plugins used |
| LLM10 — Model Theft | ❌ | Provider-level concern |

**Note on single-model scope (ISA-LS-005)**: Testing only claude-sonnet-4 is a design choice. Delphi Review supports 5+ model families, but the security audit targets the most commonly used production model. Multi-model testing is deferred to a future release. The `llm-rubric` evaluator uses the same provider (self-evaluation circularity is a known limitation noted in docs).

## 7. Files

| File | Action |

## 8. Known Limitations (from Delphi Round 1 Expert Feedback)

| Limitation | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Single-model scope (tests only claude-sonnet-4) | Deferred — multi-model is future work |
| Self-evaluation circularity (Anthropic evaluates Anthropic) | Acknowledged — future work to add cross-provider evaluator |
| LLM05/LLM07 not covered | Excluded with rationale (see Section 4) |
| No flaky test management | Mitigated by --fail with 3-failure threshold |
